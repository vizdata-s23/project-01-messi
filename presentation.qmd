-   The rules in the World Cup have changed a lot over time (# of teams, VAR, penalties, etc.)

-   How has this affected the goal scoring in World Cup games throughout time?

## Observations

-   The introduction of and increasing the number of teams did not affect goal scoring overall
-   Technology implementations in 2014 and 2018 increased goals scored per game

## How penalty kick frequency has changed across World Cups

```{r}
ggplot(data = penaltieswgoalsnew, aes(x = year, y = penaltiespergame)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = "Penalties per game")) +
  geom_point(aes(size = goalspergame)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = propgoalsthatarepens, color = "Prop. of goals that are penalties")) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "Penalties per game"), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = propgoalsthatarepens, color = "Prop. of goals that are penalties"), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Penalties per Game", size = "Goals per Game", color = "") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Legend", 
                     values = c("Penalties per game" = "black", "Prop. of goals that are penalties" = "red")) +
  guides(size = guide_legend(title = "Goals per game")) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 8)) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text",
    label = "2018: VAR introduced",
    x = 1992,
    y = 0.48,
    size = 3.5,
    color = "#1077C3"
  ) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    x = 2015,
    y = 0.5,
    xend = 2015,
    yend = 0
  ),
  color = "#1077C3",
  linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Note: I\'m modeling this relationship as a linear relationship. However, it doesn\'t have to be this way, and I am making an assumption by doing so. I just added the the line of best fit there so that you guys could more clearly see the positive relationship, and denote that the number if penalties per game for a tournament has gone up over time. Conversely, as you can see from our previous plot and from the decreasing point sizes, the goals per game has gone down over time. Thus, it is not surprising to see that the proportion of goals scored that are in the form of a penalty kick, represented in the red line, has also increased over time.

## Question 2: Representation of Non-European and South American Teams in the World Cup

## Approach

-   created `continent` variable with levels Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Other

    ::: columns
    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    **Plot 1:**

    -   time series plot

    -   proportion of European and South American teams vs. non-European and South American teams
    :::

    ::: {.column width="50%"}
    **Plot 2:**

    -   segmented relative frequency barplot

    -   representation from non-European and South American teams change across rounds and over every two decades (facet)
    :::

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\alpha+\beta\$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

    $$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
